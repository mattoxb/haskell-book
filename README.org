* Haskell Book

This will eventually be a textbook for my programming languages course.  I use Haskell for the implementation language, and students have asked for
an introduction to the language that is more specific to the course.  This book will therefore cover the parts of Haskell that are useful for writing
interpreters, and leave out a lot of things that you would find in books such as [[https://learnyouahaskell.org][Learn You a Haskell for Great Good]].

This book will also cover other topics that are covered in the coures, many which have little to do with Haskell itself.

** Status

Some of these chapters are "historical" in that they were guides I wrote earlier that were not expected to be part of a textbook.  In particular, the
sections on Lambda Calculus and Continuatioh Passing Style are here to help current students, but need to be rewritten.

Feel free to follow the repository to get updates and open issues if you find something that should be fixed.
